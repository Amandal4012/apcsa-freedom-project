### Current Progress:


**Since my past entry**, I have started tinkering with writing code with my tool, Typescript, a Javascript library. I downloaded Node.js, and used npm, which is the node package manager, to download Typescript. I then downloaded Visual Studio Code to help me code in Typescript, and convert it to Javascript so websites can read the code later on. Before I started coding with Typescript, first I had to refresh my knowledge on JavaScript's primitive data and structure types.

I mostly learned from looking at this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBPrJSw7yQA/). It was helpful in teaching me step by step visually about how to declare variable types, functions, etc. Some takeaways I had, which helped me later on when I wrote code were: `Let` can be done without initializing and 'const' needs to be initialized with a value. Once assigned, `const` can never be reassigned. Choose 'const' for a value that does not change, like a book title. Otherwise, do `let`.

When I started coding, there was an issue with my terminal. The error message stated that running scripts was disabled on my system. I went to [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4037939/powershell-says-execution-of-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system/) and it said to run Windows Powershell ISE as administrator and paste  `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`, letting me compile and run my code freely.

I then was able to write information that could be logged into the console. To illustrate, I wrote:
```
let isBeginner: boolean = true;
let total: number = 0;
let name: string = 'Amanda';
let sentence: string = `My name is ${name}
I am a beginner in Typescript`;
console.log(sentence);
```
Furthermore, I wrote a command which clearly showed me how Typescript and Javascript are linked together. I wrote `tsc app` (my file was `app.ts`), which converted my Typescript file into a Javascript file. As stated before, translating Typescript into Javascript is so it can be understood by websites, so I made sure to use this command after `ctrl+s` (saving) my code, so it would appear on my Another thing I learned was that doing `tsc app --watch` helped look for errors in my file. Then, I saw my code ran on my local host on Chrome.

I learned `null` and `undefined` are subtypes of the other types, and can be assigned to the `Boolean, number or string type`. Then, I made `arrays`. I also made `tuples`, which are a string and a number combined in an array like format.

Another cool feature I learned to utilize was ask for and then use user input. I found the answer [from stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33858763/console-input-in-typescript/). I imported the code that allowed me to use the readline node module. It resembled what I knew from Java, although the vocabulary was entirely different, so I had no trouble running and understanding it. I changed the text to ask if the user needed a productivity tool. Although I might not use this exact question in my project, I definitely can make use of user input with this module.


### Skills I refined throughout this period:
* Learning on your own
> I initially struggled a lot with reading the official Typescript Documentation. It was difficult to read and not entirely understand the application of each command for me. Therefore, I went to Youtube and other websites with Step-by-Step ways to get started with coding in Typescript. I learned that the best way to learn **for me** is by seeing it, and then attempting it for yourself.

* Time Management 
> I also had a problem with creating deadlines for myself to work on learning and writing code. Throughout these weeks, I learned that it is better to reach out to others for support if needed, and to focus on why you want to code in the first place. I want to create a tool that would increase the productivity of others, so learning is just a step on the way to making something powerful and meaningful. Once I thought of it that way, I became motivated and urgent: I scheduled blocks of time in my day to look through documentation and tutorials to code in Javascript and Typescript. 

I also think that learning Java in class, and implementing it in my code with Edhesive to create programs has made it easier to learn Javascript and therefore Typescript. There is a significant difference in syntax, but from what I can tell, there is a similar structure between Java and Javascript. The differences between Javascript and Typescript are little once I got the hang of coding in Typescript, and compiling it into a Javascript file. To sum up, I believe my prior knowledge and work in class has expanded my ability to learn different languages and use them.

### Current Stage and Next Steps:
I would say I am in the stage of creating a prototype of the engineering design process. This is because I was creating code to test Typescript's functions, and see what features I can use to create an Eisenhower Matrix To Do list. For my next steps, I will figure out how to display the results of running my code on my own website, and add or resive to my files so I can set up a chrome extension.
