###  The Freedom Project is the idea that you can code anything you want, for the purpose of a program that seeks to bring something new or helpful in your eyes.


> *In this blog, I am writing about the steps I took towards finding my tool to use in creating a project based on the Freedom Project.*


When I started brainstorming for my freedom project, I thought of what I wanted to make: I was decided on creating a website, a program or a chrome extension that helps with unproductive moods. 

I thought of how it can be challenging to get started with work, whether it is setting a routine, sitting down at the desk and opening up the texts and files necessary, etc. This spurred on the idea of making something to help people like me, who are chronic procrastinators with a touch of perfectionism, this contradictory nature that keeps progress from being made even if we want to be productive.
That is why I settled on a non-intrusive web application that is easy to access and can ease the worries of students or people who work; actually, anyone at all that has a desire to be productive.


As of now, I have a few ideas that I want to pursue, but I have not yet come to a decision on which:

* Pomodoro timer extension
* Flipclock app
* Tamagotchi extension or program (take care of it by studying)
* Generate-a-idea to do to get you motivated to study
* Reminders to take care of your health while working
* To-do list, but a unique one:

> * I came across something called the <strong>Eisenhower Matrix</strong> while searching for productivity tool ideas, 
and I clicked on todoist's blog.The Eisenhower Matrix is a group of 4 boxes, one labeled 'Do It', another, 
'Schedule It', 'Delegate It', and 'Delete It'. This helps you break down tasks into clear hierarchies of importance, 
so those tasks are not stuck bouncing around in your head, and you can be more intentional with how you work.


### **Tool:**
 I chose Typescript (A Js library) because of its *convenience*.
 It catches bugs and errors before you run your code, **reducing** the chances of getting a line wrong
 and taking less time to find the issue, than if you had just been coding without it.
 I am set currently on making a chrome extension, so learning this Javascript library,
 along with my prior knowledge of HTML and CSS  
 will be beneficial in efficiently creating a study/ work extension. I also want to use it in combination with Node.js.
 
 
#### **Other tools I considered:**

* Mocha, Chai, Hygen, Vue (very convenient), Hotkeys (keyboard input)
* Firebase and Swift (for making apps)
* Blender, Unity (complicated)

But after taking a look at Typescript, I decided this one appealed to me the most, so I will be experimenting with it for now.

I would consider myself to be in the **brainstorm possible solutions** stage in the engineering design process right now, because I started by defining the issue of a lack of productivity from low motivation/ drive. I researched ways to solve this issue, and brought up some that I would like to see.

I've thought of many, but I have not been able to decisively answer which one is *the one.* In addition, I looked into a tool that can suit most of these ideas, and in the process set up my blog for my first entry using a guide for help.

### **Some skills I developed in this step were:**

* **How to Google-** Searching for the example projects of tools I was interested in, and more about how to create a chrome extension for my ideas. 
* **How to Read-** Reading through documentation, which is how I decided what tool was right for me. 

**For the next stage**, my plans are to create experimental projects based on these ideas to figure out if they are measurable and the right project for me, while testing my tool, Typescript, in Node.js.
