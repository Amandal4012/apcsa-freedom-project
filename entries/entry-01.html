<h3><blockquote>The Freedom Project is the idea that you can code anything you want, for the purpose of a program that seeks to bring something new or helpful in your eyes.</blockquote></h3>
<br>
<p>When I started brainstorming for my freedom project, I thought of what I wanted to make: a website, a program or a chrome extension that helps with unproductive moods. </p>

<br>

<h4>I have several ideas as of now:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pomodoro timer extension</li>
<li>Flipclock app</li>
<li>Tamagotchi extension or program (take care of it by studying)</li>
<li>Generate-a-idea to do to get you motivated to study</li>
<li>Reminders to take care of your health while working.</li>
<li> To-do list, but a unique one:</li>
<ul>
<li>I came across something called the <strong>Eisenhower Matrix</strong> while searching for productivity tool ideas, 
and I clicked on todoist's blog.The Eisenhower Matrix is a group of 4 boxes, one labeled 'Do It', another, 
'Schedule It', 'Delegate It', and 'Delete It'. This helps you break down tasks into clear hierarchies of importance, 
so those tasks aren't stuck bouncing around in your head, and you can be more intentional with how you work.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3><u>Tool:</u></h3>
 <blockquote>I chose Typescript (A Js library) because of its convenience. 
 It catches bugs and errors before you run your code, reducing the chances of getting a line wrong
 and taking less time to find the issue, than if you had just been coding without it.
 I am set currently on making a chrome extension, so learning this Javascript library,
 along with my prior knowledge of HTML and CSS  
 will be beneficial in efficiently creating a study/ work extension. I also want to use it with Node.js</blockquote>
 
<br>

<h3><u>Other tools I considered:</u></h3>
- Mocha, Chai, Hygen, Vue (very convenient), Hotkeys (keyboard input) 
- Firebase and Swift (for making apps)
- Blender, Unity (complicated, may explore later)
But after taking a look at Typescript, I decided this one appealed to me the most, so I will be experimenting with it for now.

I would consider myself to be in the _ engineering design process right now, because I started researching a tool, and set up my blog for my first entry using a guide for help. My plans for the next stage are to create experimental projects and test my tool, Typescript in Node.js.

Some skills I developed in this step were searching for the example projects of tools I was interested in, and reading documentation, which is how I decided what tool was right for me.
