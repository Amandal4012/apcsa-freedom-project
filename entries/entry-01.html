I wanted to make a website or a program or a chrome extension that helps with unproductive moods. 

I have several ideas as of now:
Maybe I can make a pomodoro timer extension
a flipclock app
a tamagotchi extension or program (aka take care of me by studying or else!)
I can also make a generate-a-idea to do to get you motivated to study, 
reminders to take care of your health etc while working.
Another idea I got was to make a to-do list, but a unique one: I came across this thing called the Eisenhower Matrix while searching for productivity tool ideas, and I came across todoist's blog on it. Basically, the Eisenhower Matrix is 4 boxes, one labeled 'Do It', another, 'Schedule It', 'Delegate It', and 'Delete It'. This helps you break down tasks into clear hierarchies of importance, so those tasks aren't stuck all bouncing around in your head, and you can be more intentional with how you work.


I chose Typescript because of it's pure convenience, and it will be really helpful for one of my ideas. I am set currently on making a chrome extension, so learning this Javascript library, along with my prior knowledge of HTML and CSS will be beneficial to efficiently create an extension!

Other tools I considered:
Thinking of converting Java to Js or learning Js. Using tools Node.js, Mocha, Chai, Hygen, Vue (rlly convenient), Typescript (a savior), Hotkeys (keyboard wpm tests!!) 
-Firebase and Swift look cool but idk if making app, Blender complicated, unity idk

I would consider myself to be in the _ engineering design process right now. My plans for the next stage are to _

Some skills I developed in this step were searching for the example projects of tools I was interested in, and reading documentation, which is how I decided what tool was right for me.
