   **Since my last blog post**, I have worked on learning JS and applying it to an MVP. In my learning, I took to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) to learn the basics of JS. Their [JS tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg&t=1078s) also helped with additional comprehension and my retention of the information. I found that while making my Eisenhower to-do list, I also took inspiration from how to visually style my website like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ&list=LL&index=4) shows. From [W3Schools website](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp) and [HTML Forms](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp), I was able to create an initial to-do list with input boxes, and it also really helped me understand how to incorporate JS interactivity into my to-do list with onclick event elements.

   I am in the *creating a prototype* stage of the engineering design process. I got to this stage since I had to create the basic functions for my website so it had a foundation. I have not optimized my to do list yet to include a completed to-do bullet section, or the delete option. **For my next stage**, I will be moving on to adding more features that make the to-do list more efficient to use/ look at, and improve it as an MVP over time. I also want to add sessionStorage and LocalStorage, referencing [Javascript.info](https://javascript.info/localstorage) and [Developer.Mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Client-side_storage), so not only does the input from the user not disappear after refreshing the tab, it also does not go away from closing the tab or restarting the computer.

   *Initially*, I started with plain input boxes because I wanted to see how they worked, and create a plain version of a to-do list. This MVP can fit one’s needs as a simple list, but it does not save or an “add todo” feature.

   Next, I created the structure for an Eisenhower matrix to-do list. This _improves_ on the original design by adding a new bullet point below after inputting a todo and clicking the add button. It works by `appending`, or adding the new data to the list.

   **Some skills I practiced** in this time were attention to detail and problem decomposition. I had to follow syntax rules and make sure my code was organized and avoid errors in JS when Typescript mentioned I had repeat variables or could define the value of a variable. Then, I planned the structure of the website and how to make my Eisenhower Matrix to-do list like the ones online, with the functionality added.

   **_To sum up_**, I learned about interactivity with JS. For example, how to do input boxes and add user input to a list, I made the MVP, which lets me input new to-do bullets to each box, with their associated order of importance.
